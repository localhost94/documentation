**1st Phase**
-----

In the first phase, the objective of the application is to develop the core functionality on 4 main aspects: inventory; order; asset; and profile. The main output for the first phase is to develop a mobile application, website and IOT for the vaccine supply chain management system in Indonesia in 100 facilities with a new alternate temperature monitoring device.

**2nd Phase**
-----

In the second phase, the objective is to enhance the software on the COVID19 modules, integration with GPS location and temperature monitoring tracking, QR codes scanning for vaccine vial identifications, Online Learning website for supporting socialization and training, other advancement and API modules. Therefore, the system will increase the number of facilities, customizing features for COVID19 vaccine and logistics, interoperability between information systems (owned by Ministries, vaccine manufacturers/private sector, sub-national level, Pusdatin and Google Cloud as backup center) and Internet of Things (IoT) technology of GPS track and vial identification of vaccines (QR codes), and consequences of functions such as software maintenance, user trainings (online and offline), troubleshooting etc.

Output:
  - Software enhancement on customized reporting (web-based) to facilitate the generation and production of reports and graphical data presentation form database engine
  - Software enhancement to deploy alternate Remote Temperature Monitoring (RTM) devices that will transmit and record the temperature in gradually 600 and 3,000 facilities (from 100 facilities in original contract) in accordance with the Indonesian FDA regulation.
  - Software enhancement of mobile and web for COVID19 vaccine supply chain management system in all 12,000 Puskesmas and Public Hospitals (health facilities) as vaccination sites for Indonesian across the country (from zero facilities for COVID19 application features)
  - Develop and customized API for SMILE to be able to communicate with at least 7 (seven) national information system that has been assigned to monitor and report coverage and logistics of COVID19 immunization by the COVID-19 Response and National Economic Recovery Committee, namely: Peduli Lindungi (online registration for vaccine recipients), Trace and Track of Biofarma (logistic transportation from central to provincial level), P-Care (record the vaccine recipients),  and KPC-PEN dashboard (one-data platform), Pusdatin MoH (logistics non vaccines), Crisis Center of MoH (logistics non vaccines), National FDA (BPOM). 
  - Infrastructure provisioning with team in Data Center, the MoH
  - SMS Gateway provisioning and management
  - Bug fixing and Maintenance

**3rd Phase**
-----
In the third phase, the goals of the project is to enhance the system through software function leverage in terms of scalability (e.g. increasing number of facilities, additional modality for national flow), interoperability between information systems (owned by Ministries, vaccine manufacturers/private sector, sub-national level), Internet of Things (IoT) technology, and consequences of functions such as software maintenance, user trainings, troubleshooting etc.

Output:
  - Software enhancement on the national module of vaccine planning and/or forecasting (web-based) to facilitate the generation of accurate vaccine projections for better efficiencies.
  - Software enhancement for dashboard covid
  - Software enhancement on customized reporting (web-based) to facilitate the generation and production of reports and graphical data presentation form database engine
  - Software enhancement to deploy alternate Remote Temperature Monitoring (RTM) devices that will transmit and record the temperature in 600 facilities (from 100 facilities in original contract) in accordance with the Indonesian FDA regulation.
