The order management feature for both routine vaccines and Covid19 vaccines displays all transactions made in the order process. In this case, health workers place orders and receive orders (for purchase) of vaccines. Users can also track the ordering process, for example when there is a mismatch in the quantity along with the reason. Health workers can make orders with the optimal number of orders according to system recommendations. Order management also functions as an update of the amount of stock in a facility if there is a change when there is an order and stock delivery. In this feature, we can see the number of vaccines sent and received. Monitor the process of purchasing vaccines, purchase history to export order data.

It is easy to create a new asset by filling out the form in the website menu. The user can monitor the latest temperature from the logger and also get notified if the temperature is over the threshold value.

**Temperature Logger Monitoring**

Temperature Logger monitors the temperature in the refrigerator in real-time and sees how the condition of the refrigerator, battery capacity, battery voltage, and views temperature history for a certain period. Health officers periodically check temperature compliance and asset status. Through this function, health officers can monitor whether the refrigerator is functioning properly and does not experience problems such as power failures, malfunctions, etc. This feature monitors the temperature 24 hours a day and the sensor inside the refrigerator transmits signals every 10 minutes to the application.

When a problem occurs, the system will automatically give an alarm via SMS to the Puskesmas staff to take protective actions against the vaccine, such as resetting the refrigerator thermostat, or moving the vaccine to a cool box, or temporary refrigerator until the refrigerator temperature returns to normal.

We may examine detailed statistical data on the total distribution of Covid-19 vaccinations in the Covid-19 Inventory Dashboard. The data shown is real-time data from the Indonesian Ministry of Health, vaccination warehouses, Provincial Health Offices, City District Health Offices, and Community Health Centers.

Total receipts, returns, distributions, distribution returns, total disposals, total consumption, and remaining vaccine supply are all displayed on this dashboard. There is a filter option that allows us to search by time, material tag, material type, material name, province name, city district, and health facility.

The District/City Health Office uses the Annual Planning function to calculate vaccination requirements and routine immunization logistics for one year. Typically, this calculation is performed toward the end of the year (2021) for the requirements of the following year (2022).

Calculation of vaccine needs & logistics is measured from the number of vaccination targets consisting of live births, surviving infants, infants under two years of age, 1, 2, 5, and 6-grade students, and women of childbearing age (including pregnant women) multiplied by the number administration of each vaccine, then divided by the index of the use of each vaccine.

   Number of Needs
   =(Number of Targets * Number of Vaccination Administration) / (Index of Vaccine Use)
   

The Annual Planning for the next vaccine distribution including:
-	Configuration management

Disposal Management aims to record waste material in health facilities. Because not all waste can be disposed of at the facility, SMILE has the capability of sending waste to other facilities on a higher level. Because the user can see the reason for the discard transaction, they can decide whether to dispose of the waste themselves or send it to other facilities.

This Disposal feature consists of several functionalities, including:
   - After a discard transaction is created, update the disposal stock directly.
   - View Stock of Disposal and get detail the reason of discard.
   - When the facilities dispose of material on their own, they can create a self-disposal transaction.
   - Sent to other facilities.
   - Receive from disposal distribution.
   - Cancel disposal distribution.
